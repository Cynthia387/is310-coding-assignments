# Command Maze: Romeo and Juliet
### by Cynthia Shen

## Goal
Solve a command-line maze built from directories and text files.
Your objective is to navigate the maze and reach the final solution
using only command-line tools.

## What You might Need

- ls
- cd
- pwd
- cat
- less
- head / tail
- grep
- wc
- find

## Rules
- Start inside the `maze/entrance/` directory
- Do not open all files at once — follow the clues
- Some clues require searching inside text files
- There is **one hidden directory** in this maze

## How to Start
From this folder, run:

```bash
cd maze/entrance
ls
cat welcome.txt
