LEVEL 2: Convenience Narrative

Single-serving meal videos often emphasize speed and immediacy.

CHALLENGE (CODE3):

Find the FIRST line number where the word "quick" appears
in romeo_juliet.txt.

Rules:
- The search should be case-insensitive
- Count only whole-word matches
- Use only the first occurrence

CODE3 = the line number of the first match.

Hint:
Look for a command that prints line numbers,
then keep only the first result.

Once you have CODE3, do NOT move to the next level directly.

Instead:
This directory contains several doors (subfolders).
Only ONE door contains the passage forward.

Explore them using the command line.
