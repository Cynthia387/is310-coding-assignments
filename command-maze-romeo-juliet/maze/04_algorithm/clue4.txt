LEVEL 4: Algorithmic Signals

Algorithms reward repeated signals.
In stories, character names act like signals.

CHALLENGE (CODE5):

Count the occurrences of the whole word "Romeo" and the whole word "Juliet"
in romeo_juliet.txt.

Rules:
- Case-insensitive
- Whole-word matches only

CODE5 = (count of Romeo) - (count of Juliet)

Hint:
You may need to run similar commands more than once
and compare the results.

Once you have CODE5, return to this directory.

Do NOT jump ahead.
