FINAL KEY — Exit Instructions

You have collected all five codes:
CODE1, CODE2, CODE3, CODE4, CODE5

To unlock the exit, you must create a file called:

unlock.txt

inside the exit directory.

The content of unlock.txt must be exactly:

CODE1-CODE2-CODE3-CODE4-CODE5

(use hyphens, no spaces)

Hint:
Use a command-line tool to write text into a file.

Once this file exists, go to:
../exit/

and read:
solution.txt
