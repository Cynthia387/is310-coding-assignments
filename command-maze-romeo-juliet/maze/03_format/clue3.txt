LEVEL 3: Format and Structure

Short-form content relies on recognizable formats.
Plays also follow strict structural patterns.

CHALLENGE (CODE4):

In romeo_juliet.txt, ACT headings define the structure
(e.g., ACT I, ACT II, ACT III).

Find how many UNIQUE ACT headings appear in the text.

CODE4 = number of unique ACT headings.

Hint:
- Extract only lines that start with ACT
- Remove duplicates
- Count the remaining lines

Once you have CODE4, do NOT proceed directly.

Instead:
There are doors (subfolders) in this directory.
Only one door leads forward.

Use the command line to explore and determine the correct path.
