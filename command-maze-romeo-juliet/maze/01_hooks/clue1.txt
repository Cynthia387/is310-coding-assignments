LEVEL 1: Hooks and Repetition

On short-video platforms like TikTok, repetition is a key hook.

CHALLENGE (CODE2):

Using the file romeo_juliet.txt, find how many times the word
"love" appears in the text.

Rules:
- The search should be case-insensitive
- Count only the word "love", not parts of other words

CODE2 = total number of occurrences of "love"

Hint:
You may need to combine a command that searches text
with a command that counts lines.

Once you have CODE2, do NOT move to the next level directly.

Instead:
In this directory, there are several doors (subfolders).
Only ONE door leads forward.

Use the command line to explore them and find the passage
that tells you where to go next.
